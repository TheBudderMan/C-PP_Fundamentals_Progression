# C-PP_Fundamentals_Progression

I spent a semester at Bow Valley College and while they kicked me out for prodding around about some HR issues, 

I still have all the projects I did so it's okay. 

These are just basic fundamentals assignments done in C++. 

Some were cool but they're just little things for learning the fundamentals of basic programming.
